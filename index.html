<p>This project demonstrates how to use Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to host a simple service from within a console application and consume that service from a simple WPF app. </p>

<p>The simple Magic8Ball replies to questions with a random response from a pre-defined list of possible responses.</p>

<p>The service is hosted by a simple console application to illustrate that apps can host services too! This service is exposed simultaneously using XML/HTTP and BinaryXML/TCP endpoints. The service will also respond to HTTP-GET's with a service description page - point your browser at the service's HTTP endpoint for more details.</p>

<p>The client app is a simple WPF app that lets you ask questions of the Magic8Ball service and displays the answer provided.</p>

<p>This project also shows how to configure services &amp; clients using app.config, significantly reducing the quantity of code required to hook-up a client to a service, whilst greatly increasing post-deployment flexibility. Read Magic8BallApp's app.config for more details.</p>

<p>I have used variations of this app for many years to explain and demonstrate key WCF features. I hope you find it useful.</p>

<p>Play. Tweak. Modify. Enjoy!</p>
