{"name":"Magic8ball","tagline":"Magic8Ball WCF demo app and service","body":"#Magic8Ball WCF Demo App and Service\r\n\r\nThis project demonstrates how to use Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to host a simple service from within a console application and consume that service from a simple WPF app. \r\n\r\nThe simple Magic8Ball replies to questions with a random response from a pre-defined list of possible responses.\r\n\r\nThe service is hosted by a simple console application to illustrate that apps can host services too! This service is exposed simultaneously using XML/HTTP and BinaryXML/TCP endpoints. The service will also respond to HTTP-GET's with a service description page - point your browser at the service's HTTP endpoint for more details.\r\n\r\nThe client app is a simple WPF app that lets you ask questions of the Magic8Ball service and displays the answer provided.\r\n\r\nThis project also shows how to configure services & clients using app.config, significantly reducing the quantity of code required to hook-up a client to a service, whilst greatly increasing post-deployment flexibility. Read Magic8BallApp's app.config for more details.\r\n\r\nI have used variations of this app for many years to explain and demonstrate key WCF features. I hope you find it useful.\r\n\r\nPlay. Tweak. Modify. Enjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
